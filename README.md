# Project Title :  Melbourne Public Trasport Trends by passenger footfall and Housing sales 

###### Project 1: Group1

###### Members : Talieh, Yared, Peter, Abhi

Trying to understand footfall and housing sales from melbouurne cbd and as you go out from the cbd  

## Data Analysis Proposal 

**Aim** : The aim of this project is to investigate Melbourne Housing market sales and transportation data by city council areas. Specifically looking into footfall by train usage in each area and identifying if there is a correlation with Housing market sales.

**Description:**
The aim of the project is to analyse the share of the different public transport modes and study the correlation between the passenger footfall for metro train & the housing sale data for the years between 2018-2021 in Melbourne Metropolitan.

In this project, we will analyse the footfall of each city council area and compared it with each area's house and apartment sales. We will also need to look into the distance of city council areas from Melbourne CBD as this may be a factor in types 'homes' that will be purchased.  

### Data Sources

The project will draw its main data from the Department of Transport and Planning under the Government of Victoria.

1. [Annual Metropolitan Train Station Patronage (Station entries](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/annual-metropolitan-train-station-patronage-station-entries)
>Total and daily average of patronage for Melbourne metroplitan train stations.
>
>Patronage estimates are derived from myki ticketing data and factored up to account for the transaction rate. The transaction rate is determined by survey and by barrier count data at gated stations.
2. [Annual Regional Train Station Patronage (Station Entries)](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/annual-regional-train-patronage-station-entries)
>Total annual patronage (station entries) for Victorian regional train stations.
>
>Patronage estimates for stations on the myki network are derived from myki ticketing data and factored up to account for the transaction rate. The transaction rate is determined by conductor counts and by barrier count data at gated stations.
3. [Monthly Public Transport Patronage by Mode](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/monthly-public-transport-patronage-by-mode)
>Monthly total patronage for metropolitan and regional train, metropolitan and regional bus, tram and regional coach services in Victoria.
>
>Patronage is a count of patron boardings onto services, with the exclusion of train transfers that do not involve a change in direction. Patrons includes all persons 5 and over, excluding drivers and station staff.
4. [Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA)](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victorian-integrated-survey-of-travel-and-activity)
>The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) is an ongoing survey of household travel activity.
>
>all members of surveyed households are asked to complete a travel diary for a single specified day.
5. [Property Sales Statistics](https://www.land.vic.gov.au/valuations/resources-and-reports/property-sales-statistics)
>The Valuer-General Victoria (VGV) releases comprehensive sales data for houses, units, vacant residential land and commercial, industrial and rural properties.
>
>The data is compiled using information lodged every time a property sale is completed

### Key Objectives

1. Transport Trends 
- Assess the trends and performance indicators for each individual train line, aggregating data for all stations along each line.

2. Passenger Footfall 
- For each station, the team will calculate and analyze changes in footfall.

3.Proximity to Central Business District (CBD) 
- Examine the distance of each city council area from the CBD.


4. Mode of Transport Share
- Investigate the distribution of different modes of transportation, shedding light on the popularity and efficiency of each mode.

5. Station Analysis
- Stations offering multiple transport options will be compared against more remote stations to identify patterns related to accessibility and connectivity.

6. Real Estate and Property Sales Examination
- Correlate public transport data with real estate sales information to understand the potential impact of transport accessibility on property transactions.


#### Summary

* The passenger footfall is significantly higher for CBD and surrounding councils due to presence of offices. 
* The transit/tourist hubs and last stations of the metro lines generally witness higher footfall.
* The apartments/units sell is higher for councils closer to CBD while plot sell is higher for councils away from CBD and vice versa.
* Above analysis is in line with VISTA survey conducted

#### Future prospects 

* A similar research can be conducted for each suburb with/without census data for more detailed understanding the city growth.
* The passenger footfall data along with PTV timetable can be studied to analyze trend for each metro line which can be helpful to improve timetable in future.

1) Trends for each line (sum of all stations on each line)
2) Percentage increase for individual station
3) Percentage decrease for individual station
4) Distance from CBD
5) Share of different modes of transport
6) Stations with multiple transport options against remote stations

For API
1) Real eastate - propery sell
2) Census - population for two census cycle
