Project Title : Melbourne Metro Trasport Trends by passenger footfall

1) Trends for each line (sum of all stations on each line)
2) Percentage increase for individual station
3) Percentage decrease for individual station
4) Distance from CBD
5) Share of different modes of transport
6) Stations with multiple transport options against remote stations

For API
1) Real eastate - propery sell
2) Census - population for two census cycle

#Proposal

The purpose of this project is to analyse the modes of transport in Melbourne, with a specific focus on trains, and assess the footfall in each city council area. Additionally, the analysis will incorporate Melbourne's real estate sales data to investigate if there is any correlation between higher footfall and property sale trends. 



Project Title : Melbourne Public Trasport Trends by passenger footfall and housing sell
Members : Talieh, Yared, Peter, Abhi
Aim : The aim of this project is to evaluate the different modes of public trasport in each city council area of Melbourne Metropolitin for period of 2018-2023 with a emphasis on metro/trains. Furthermore, the investigation will integrate data from Melbourne's real estate sales to examine any potential associations between increased foot traffic and property sale patterns.
Data sources : Primary data source is various open source data files of Department of Transport and Planning, Goevernment of victoria. We are also analysis VISTA survey.

#Proposal

The aim of the project is to analyse the share of the different public transport modes and study the correlation between the passenger footfall for metro train & the housing sale data for the year 2018-21 in Melbourne Metropolitan



Data Sources
The project will draw its main data from sources such as the Department of Transport and Planning under the Government of Victoria. The team will also utilize insights from the VISTA survey to enrich the analysis.

Key Objectives

1. Transport Trends 

The project will systematically assess the trends and performance indicators for each individual train line, aggregating data for all stations along each line.

2. Passanger Footfal

For each station, the team will calculate and analyze percentage changes in footfall, providing valuable insights into usage patterns over time.

3. Proximity to Central Business District (CBD)

The distance of each station from the Central Business District (CBD) will be examined to discern spatial relationships and accessibility patterns.

4. Mode of Transport Share

The project will investigate the distribution of different modes of transportation, shedding light on the popularity and efficiency of each mode.

5. Station Analysis

Stations offering multiple transport options will be compared against more remote stations to identify patterns related to accessibility and connectivity.

6. Real Estate and Property Sales Examination

 The team will correlate public transport data with real estate sales information to understand the potential impact of transport accessibility on property transactions.


Summary

* The passenger footfall is significantly higher for CBD and surrounding councils due to presence of offices. 
* The transit/tourist hubs and last stations of the metro lines generally witness higher footfall.
* The apartments/units sell is higher for councils closer to CBD while plot sell is higher for councils away from CBD and vice versa.
* Above analysis is in line with VISTA survey conducted

Future prospects 

* A similar research can be conducted for each suburb with/without census data for more detailed understanding the city growth.
* The passenger footfall data along with PTV timetable can be studied to analyze trend for each metro line which can be helpful to improve timetable in future.
