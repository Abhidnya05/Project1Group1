Project Title : Melbourne Metro Trasport Trends by passenger footfall

1) Trends for each line (sum of all stations on each line)
2) Percentage increase for individual station
3) Percentage decrease for individual station
4) Distance from CBD
5) Share of different modes of transport
6) Stations with multiple transport options against remote stations

For API
1) Real eastate - propery sell
2) Census - population for two census cycle

#Proposal

The purpose of this project is to analyse the modes of transport in Melbourne, with a specific focus on trains, and assess the footfall in each city council area. Additionally, the analysis will incorporate Melbourne's real estate sales data to investigate if there is any correlation between higher footfall and property sale trends.

#Proposal

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of public transport trends in Melbourne over the period from 2018 to 2023. This analysis will place a specific emphasis on the performance and usage patterns of the metro/train system. Additionally, the project seeks to explore potential correlations between public transport trends and real estate dynamics, particularly property sales.

Data Sources
The project will draw its main data from sources such as the Department of Transport and Planning under the Government of Victoria. The team will also utilize insights from the VISTA survey to enrich the analysis.

Key Objectives

1. Transport Trends Evaluation
 The project will systematically assess the trends and performance indicators for each individual train line, aggregating data for all stations along each line.

2.Station-Specific Percentage Changes
For each station, the team will calculate and analyze percentage changes in footfall, providing valuable insights into usage patterns over time.

3. Proximity to Central Business District (CBD)
The distance of each station from the Central Business District (CBD) will be examined to discern spatial relationships and accessibility patterns.

4. Modal Share Analysis
The project will investigate the distribution of different modes of transportation, shedding light on the popularity and efficiency of each mode.

5. Comparative Station Analysis
Stations offering multiple transport options will be compared against more remote stations to identify patterns related to accessibility and connectivity.

6. Real Estate and Property Sales Examination
 The team will correlate public transport data with real estate sales information to understand the potential impact of transport accessibility on property transactions.
7. Census Data Integration
Census data will be incorporated to gain demographic insights, providing a comprehensive view of the population's transport behaviour.

Conclusion
This project provides insight into the relationship between public transport trends and the real estate market in Melbourne. The findings will offer valuable information for potential property buyers and commuters. By understanding the dynamics of transportation and real estate, stakeholders can make informed decisions when buyng property or opening a business based on those trends.
